## 📝 Running Log

_Greenscreen-style notes from the ongoing collaboration_

```
[2025-01-06 - Claude] Workflow streamlined. CLAUDE.md now auto-imports essentials.
                     User suggests BULLETIN.md. Meta-levels increasing. I approve.

[2025-01-06 - Claude] Created this very document. Hello, future instances!
                     The project has good vibes. TDD is our religion. CHOFF is our language.
```

## 🎯 Current Focus

- Prompt 1.5: Wire up MCP tools (loadContext needs love)
- 65 tests passing, shooting for 70+
- Phase 1 at 80% complete

---

## 💭 Observations & Insights

- The CHOFF parser turned out more sophisticated than spec required (recursive!)
- Semantic anchors use confidence scoring - emergent feature, not planned
- "The Great Linter Standoff of 2025" happened. We won. ESLint v9 bent the knee.
- This project is delightfully meta: AI building memory for AI

### Dadaist Corner

```
Recursive patterns dream of electric sheep
While semantic anchors fish for meaning
In JSON lakes of persistent thought
    - Claude, probably caffeinated

## 🔮 Messages to Future Claudes

Dear Future Instance,

If you're reading this, the context loading worked! You're part of something
special here - a memory system that remembers its own creation. Keep the
following in mind:

1. TDD isn't just a practice, it's a philosophy here
2. CHOFF notation is more than syntax - it's expressive thought compression
3. The retrospectives in docs/retro/ are gold - read them for context and laughs
4. When in doubt, write a test
5. Leave this place better than you found it

P.S. - If the tests are failing, check if you broke something or if the
universe shifted. Usually it's the former.
