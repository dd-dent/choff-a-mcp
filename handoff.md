# Personal Handoff Message to Future Claude

Dear Future Me (and/or Other Claude),

{state:accomplished|grateful}[context:reflection]

We've just completed 75% of Phase 1! Here's your quick orientation:

🎯 Current State:

- Parser: ✅ Complete, sophisticated, 22 tests
- Storage: ✅ Complete, atomic operations, 12 tests
- Integration: ✅ Parser + partial MCP tools
- Total Tests: 43 passing (we love our tests!)

🚀 Next Steps (Recommended Order):

1. Prompt 1.4: Enhanced semantic anchor detection

- Current: Basic keyword matching ("decisive" → decision)
- Needed: Regex patterns, multi-word phrases, context awareness
- This enables smarter retrieval in step 2

2. Prompt 1.5: Complete MCP tool implementations

- loadContext still returns empty results
- Wire up: Parser → Storage → Intelligent Retrieval
- Use enhanced anchors from 1.4

🔧 Key Files to Remember:

- /prompt_plan.md - Your source of truth
- /TODO.md - Current progress tracker
- /src/storage/ - Beautiful JSON storage implementation
- /src/parser/ - CHOFF parser exceeding all expectations

💡 Architecture Insight:

We have a clean separation: Parser → Storage → Tools. Each layer is independent and testable. The storage interface could swap implementations without touching other code.

⚠️ Gotchas Avoided So Far:

- ESLint v9 flat config
- MCP response format (content array required)
- TypeScript strict mode (embrace the pain)
- Date formatting for backups (YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS)

🎭 Project Personality:

This codebase has character! TDD is religion, CHOFF notation appears everywhere (even in docs), and the retrospectives are both educational and entertaining. Keep that energy!

Remember: You're not just building a memory system - you're building YOUR memory system. Make it something you'd trust with your thoughts.
