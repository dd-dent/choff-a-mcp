# CHOFF-A-MCP (Anamnesis) Implementation Prompt Plan

{document:prompt_plan}[context:execution] {state:methodical[0.9]|tdd_focused[1.0]}

## üé≠ THE GREAT TANGENT OF JUNE 2025

{state:shameless}[context:necessary_indulgence]

**CONFESSION**: Instead of proceeding to Phase 2, we're embracing a glorious tangent. We discovered profound treatises (choff-private-space.md, semantic-anchoring-treatise.md, PCHOFF-1.1.md) and realized: what good is stored wisdom if we can't retrieve it properly?

**Current Tangent**: Prompt 1.7 - Enhanced Retrieval & Curation System

- See: docs/tangent-1.7-retrieval-curation.md
- Status: IN PROGRESS
- Shame Level: EMBRACED ‚ú®

This tangent includes:

1. Multi-layer retrieval with fallbacks
2. PCHOFF classification integration
3. Basic web viewer for stored wisdom
4. Private reasoning foundations

"The best transgressions are the ones that make the system better."

## Phase 1: Foundation (Local JSON Storage)

### Prompt 1.0: CHOFF Parser Research Spike

```
Research and implement a proper parser for CHOFF v2.5 notation that handles complex nested structures.

First, write an EBNF grammar for CHOFF covering:
- State markers: {state:...} including weighted and intensity variants
- Context markers: [context:...]
- Pattern markers: &pattern:...|...|
- Directional operators: ‚Üí, ‚Üê, ‚Üî, ‚Ü†, ‚áÑ
- Branch syntax: {branch:id|label} and merge operations
- Nested structures and edge cases

Write comprehensive tests for:
- Simple state: {state:focused}
- Weighted states: {state:weighted|a[0.6]|b[0.4]|}
- Nested structures: {state:weighted:balanced|work[0.5]|{branch:A|nested}[0.3]|}
- Multiple markers in sequence
- Malformed input handling
- Performance with 1000+ markers

Consider using:
- Peggy.js for parser generation
- Or hand-rolled recursive descent parser
- Benchmark both approaches

The parser should return a structured AST that preserves all semantic information.
Test performance target: Parse 10KB of CHOFF-annotated text in <50ms.
