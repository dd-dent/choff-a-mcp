# Naval Systems Analysis Performance Report

{state:analytical}[context:performance_analysis] &pattern:temporal|metrics|

## Executive Summary

{state:focused}[context:metrics/overview]
A two-phase naval systems thinking exploration was executed with remarkably efficient parallel processing:

- Total wall clock time: 6m 48s
- Total compute time: 25m 13s
- Effective parallelization: 3.7x speedup
- Total token consumption: 637.4k tokens

## Phase Analysis

{state:detailed}[context:phase_metrics]

### Phase One Performance

→ 5 parallel specialized units

- Longest task: DevOps (3m 17.7s)
- Average token usage: 42.6k per task
- Total phase tokens: 213k
  &pattern:efficiency|high|

### Phase Two Performance

→ 5 parallel cross-perspective tasks

- Longest task: DevOps Synthesis (3m 29.8s)
- Average token usage: 78.9k per task
- Total phase tokens: 424.4k
  &pattern:complexity|increased|

## Key Insights

{state:analytical&curious}[context:observations]

1. Token Usage Pattern ↠

   - Phase Two required ~2x tokens vs Phase One
   - Suggests significant complexity in cross-perspective integration

2. Execution Pattern ↠

   - Consistent parallel execution benefits
   - Phase Two tasks show higher but consistent token usage

3. Performance Characteristics →
   - Parallel processing highly effective
   - Cross-perspective tasks more resource-intensive
   - Consistent completion times suggest good load balancing

{state:conclusive}[context:recommendations]
Future iterations could potentially:

- Pre-cache common context to reduce token usage
- Optimize cross-perspective data sharing
- Consider intermediate checkpoints for longer synthesis tasks
