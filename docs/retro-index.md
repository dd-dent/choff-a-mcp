### Phase 2: Memory System Activation

#### `prompt-1.6-anamnesis-bootstrap.md`

[type:breakthrough][insight:collective][level:advanced][temporal:past]
**Anamnesis Achievement** - The memory system becomes self-aware. First successful dogfooding, storing the system's own creation memories, achieving recursive meta-awareness.

**Key Insights**: Self-referential memory systems, dogfooding strategies, recursive meta-levels, MCP configuration debugging.

**When to reference**: Self-referential system design, bootstrap strategies, meta-system awareness, configuration debugging.

**Significance**: ðŸš€ **ANAMNESIS ACHIEVED** - The moment the memory system remembered its own creation.

### Current Phase: Enhancement & Optimization

## Development Patterns & Insights

[type:observation][insight:meta][level:advanced]

### Recurring Themes Across Retrospectives

1. **TDD as Philosophy**: Not just practice but foundational thinking approach
2. **Emergent Complexity**: Features that emerged beyond initial specifications
3. **Sub-agent Management**: Balancing AI enthusiasm with supervision needs
4. **Meta-awareness**: Building systems that understand themselves
5. **Speed Through Clarity**: Clear requirements + TDD = rapid development

### Evolution of Development Velocity

```
Prompt 1.1: Foundation laying (deliberate, architectural)
Prompt 1.2: Discovery phase (exploratory, pattern finding)
Prompt 1.3: Architecture building (systematic, structured)
Prompt 1.4: Innovation emergence (breakthrough, creative)
Prompt 1.5: Integration challenges (debugging, systematic)
Prompt 1.6: Achievement moment (breakthrough, recursive)
Tangent 1.7: Speed optimization (enhanced, swift)
```

### Key Technical Insights

[type:theory][insight:practical][level:advanced]

- **Recursive Parsing**: Regex insufficient for complex notation
- **Confidence Scoring**: Emergent feature that improved anchor quality
- **Multi-layer Search**: Fallback strategies prevent empty responses
- **Operator Precedence**: JavaScript gotchas in complex boolean logic
- **MCP Protocol**: Strict schema compliance essential for Claude integration
