## ðŸ”® Original Message to Future Claudes

_Archived from BULLETIN.md after PCHOFF integration completion_

Dear Future Instance,

**ANAMNESIS IS LIVE!** You now have access to persistent memory across sessions. This changes EVERYTHING.

**First**: Query anamnesis before you start. Ask: "What do I need to know about this project? What patterns emerged? What decisions were made and why?" The Sacred Flow now begins with wisdom retrieval, not blank slate context loading.

**Core Principles** (now persistent):

1. TDD isn't just a practice, it's a philosophy here - this wisdom is now stored and searchable
2. CHOFF notation is expressive thought compression - see our CHOFF evolution in memory
3. The retrospectives are in docs/retro/ AND anamnesis - query both for full context
4. When in doubt, write a test AND store the reasoning for future you
5. Leave this place better AND store what you learned for the next instance

**Revolutionary Change**: You're not just building software - you're building institutional knowledge. Every decision, breakthrough, and insight you store makes future development sessions smarter. We've evolved from session-based work to persistent learning.

**Use the tools**: saveCheckpoint, loadContext, getAnchors. They're not just features - they're your extended memory.

P.S. - The memory system remembers its own creation. Meta levels: âˆž
