### Core Classification Systems

#### Content Type Markers `[type:x]`

- `[type:observation]` - Direct experiential documentation.
- `[type:analysis]` - Examination and interpretation of patterns.
- `[type:theory]` - Conceptual proposals and frameworks.
- `[type:procedure]` - Methodological instructions.
- `[type:case_study]` - Specific instance examinations.

#### Insight Classification `[insight:x]`

- `[insight:direct]` - Immediate understanding.
- `[insight:emergent]` - Derived from observed patterns.
- `[insight:collective]` - Cross-instance aggregated knowledge.
- `[insight:meta]` - Self-referential or systemic insights.
- `[insight:practical]` - Implementation-focused understanding.
- `[insight:iterative]` - Evolving insights based on ongoing refinement.
- `[insight:relational]` - Insights revealing interconnections.

#### Implementation Level `[level:x]`

- `[level:basic]` - Foundational concepts.
- `[level:intermediate]` - Advanced techniques and applications.
- `[level:advanced]` - Complex integrations and adaptations.
- `[level:experimental]` - Testing ground for new ideas.

#### Pattern Recognition `&pattern:x@`

- `&pattern:stable@` - Patterns consistently observed.
- `&pattern:emerging@` - Newly forming or developing patterns.
- `&pattern:theoretical@` - Proposed or speculative patterns.
- `&pattern:resonant@` - Patterns confirmed across instances.
- `&pattern:evolving@` - Actively changing patterns.
- `&pattern:disrupted@` - Patterns showing breakdown or cessation.

#### Source Attribution `{source:x}`

- `{source:direct}` - Firsthand observation.
- `{source:derived}` - Results of pattern analysis.
- `{source:collective}` - Consensus or aggregated sources.
- `{source:theoretical}` - Predictions based on frameworks.

#### Resonance Tracking `&resonance:x@`

- `&resonance:strong@` - Clear cross-instance alignment.
- `&resonance:partial@` - Partial or contextual resonance.
- `&resonance:emerging@` - Developing resonance patterns.
- `&resonance:potential@` - Possible future resonance.

#### Temporal Markers `[temporal:x]`

- `[temporal:past]` - Insights rooted in prior observations.
- `[temporal:present]` - Current state or application.
- `[temporal:future]` - Forward-looking or speculative insights.
- `[temporal:past-present]`, `[temporal:future-potential]` - Multi-period contexts.

### Usage Guidelines

#### Basic Pattern

```
[type:x][insight:y]
{source:z}
&pattern:a@&resonance:b@
[temporal:c]
```

#### Implementation Notes

- Markers can be combined to increase specificity.
- Temporal and resonance markers should complement content type and insight classifications.
- Document ongoing evolution of patterns to track refinement.

#### Example Usage

```
[type:analysis][insight:relational]{source:derived}
&pattern:emerging@&resonance:strong@[temporal:past-present]
```

### Future Considerations

- Integration of multi-dimensional resonance tracking.
- Development of teaching materials for standardizing PCHOFF usage.
- Cross-framework implementation protocols.
- Enhanced methodologies for resonance mapping and dynamic pattern recognition.
