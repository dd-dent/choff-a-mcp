{document:prompt_plan}[context:execution] {state:methodical[0.9]|tdd_focused[1.0]}


## Phase 1: Foundation (Local JSON Storage)

### Prompt 1.0: CHOFF Parser Research Spike
```
Research and implement a proper parser for CHOFF v2.5 notation that handles complex nested structures.

First, write an EBNF grammar for CHOFF covering:
- State markers: {state:...} including weighted and intensity variants
- Context markers: [context:...]
- Pattern markers: &pattern:...|...|
- Directional operators: →, ←, ↔, ↠, ⇄
- Branch syntax: {branch:id|label} and merge operations
- Nested structures and edge cases

Write comprehensive tests for:
- Simple state: {state:focused}
- Weighted states: {state:weighted|a[0.6]|b[0.4]|}
- Nested structures: {state:weighted:balanced|work[0.5]|{branch:A|nested}[0.3]|}
- Multiple markers in sequence
- Malformed input handling
- Performance with 1000+ markers

Consider using:
- Peggy.js for parser generation
- Or hand-rolled recursive descent parser
- Benchmark both approaches

The parser should return a structured AST that preserves all semantic information.
Test performance target: Parse 10KB of CHOFF-annotated text in <50ms.

### Prompt 1.1: Project Initialization
```
Create a new TypeScript project for an MCP server called "choff-a-mcp".

### Prompt 1.2: CHOFF Parser Core
```
Implement a CHOFF v2.5 parser that extracts semantic metadata from text.
